Ever felt that playing Terraria with normal gravity was too convenient? Probably not, but let's try reversing gravity anyway! Just make sure you don't fall into outer space.

===================================

Notes:
- You will want to make sure you have a ceiling above your spawnpoint before you install this mod.
- The Gravity Globe item is useless with this mod installed. 

===================================

Features:
- Reversed gravity. Yep.
- Play the game upside-down.
- Dig upwards to get to hell.
- Regain control of gravity using Gravitation Potions.
- Unless you have the Gravitation Potion effect active, you fall out of earth's orbit if you hit the top of the world.

===================================

Tips:
- Seriously, build a ceiling above your spawnpoint before you install this mod.
- Platforms don't seem to like you being upside-down (I don't know why), so make sure you use solid tiles to walk on whenever you can. 
- If you absolutely need platforms for whatever reason, you can still grapple onto them.
